## Introduction

Welcome to Hacker Whacker, a themed whack-a-mole style game about stopping hackers from penetrating your security. The aim is to click quickly on appearing hackers to make them disappear and earn points for doing so. Missed hackers or incorrect decisions can lead to a loss of points. The user will receive a final score at the end of the game showing how well they did.

This website was created during Hackathon 2 of the "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 02/07/2024 to 04/07/2024 (1.30pm). Planning and preparation for the Hackathon was conducted over the four days surrounding the weekend before (28-06-2024 to 01-07-2024). There was no clear specification to follow, but the following requirements were given.

* The main goal is the creation of an interactive front-end web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* The site should meet the purpose it was designed for.
* Navigation from page to page should be clear and obvious to the user.
* Any CSS animations used should not be overwhelming or over the top.
* Apropriate feedback should be given to user interaction as required.
* The site must work responsively on all screen sizes, including mobile, tablet and desktop.
* Error handling should be implemented as required. This also includes ensuring that the site does not break if the user behaves unexpectedly.
* All images should have the correct aspect ratio and be of an apropriate size.
* The HTML, CSS and JavaScript code should pass W3C and JSHint validation.
* Semantic HTML should be used as apropriate.
* No commented-out code should be left in the project at the end.
* The project should be fully documented in a Markdown format (as in this document)
* Full credits should be given for all material used from external sources. This includes frameworks, code and images etc.
* All code should be apropriately commented.
* A standard file/folder structure should be used to store all content.
* File and variable names should be apropriately chosen according to their function.
* The site should be tested fully to ensure everything works as expected.
* There should be no developer console errors.
* The project should be managed using a project board.
* The game should be as accessible as possible. This involves the following steps:-
    * Making sure colour contrast is clearly well-defined throughout the site.
    * Ensuring all images have an apropriate alt text
